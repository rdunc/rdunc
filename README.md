## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Ryan Duncan
I'm a self taught Full Stack Engineer. I've been programming and learning anything that peaks my interest for 20+ years. I've used many languages and frameworks over the years such as **TypeScript**, **React**, a little bit **Rust**, **C# (.NET CORE)**, **PHP (Laravel & WordPress)**, and **Go** to name a few. I love consuming any kind of knowledge that I can get my hands on as many topics peak my interest.

### ðŸ’¬ Want to hire me?
I want my code to make a difference in someone's life whether it be making apps that help improve their day to day business or something that adds to their quality of life. I want to be part of something awesome by building apps, websites, or software that people use in their everyday lives.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
I am currently learning Rust by creating a note taking app called [Noteo](https://github.com/rdunc/noteo) with [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri), which allows me to use React along side Rust.
